Root-Level Files
	1.	app.py
Main entry point for the Dash application. Here you’ll import your layout, register callbacks, and run the server.
	2.	requirements.txt
Python dependencies needed to run the application (e.g., Dash, Plotly, Pandas).
	3.	README.md
You are here! Documentation about how to set up, run, and develop on this project.
	4.	.gitignore
A list of files and directories that should be ignored by Git (e.g., Python cache files, virtual environment folders, etc.).

src/ Folder

This folder contains the core logic of your Dash app.
	•	src/data/
	•	data_preprocessing.py: Functions or classes for data wrangling, cleaning, and feature engineering.
	•	data_loader.py: Methods or classes for reading data from CSV, databases, or APIs.
	•	src/layouts/
	•	main_layout.py: Defines the structure of your Dash app. You might have layout = html.Div([...]) that you import into app.py.
	•	src/callbacks/
	•	main_callbacks.py: Houses your @app.callback definitions to handle interactivity (e.g., updating graphs based on user input).

assets/ Folder
	•	custom.css: Custom CSS to style your Dash app (overrides default Dash/Plotly styles).
	•	custom.js: Custom JavaScript if you need advanced or specialized client-side interactions.

tests/ Folder
	•	test_app.py: Basic tests for the application using a testing framework like pytest or unittest. Could include UI testing, callback output checks, etc.

docs/ Folder
	•	images/dashboard_screenshot.png: Place any screenshots, diagrams, or additional documentation here.
	•	Any other Markdown or text files related to project documentation.

2.	Explore the Dashboard
	•	Open your browser and navigate to the URL displayed in your terminal (typically http://127.0.0.1:8050).
	•	Interact with the dashboard to explore data insights and visualizations.

3.	Develop & Customize
	•	Update data preprocessing in src/data/data_preprocessing.py.
	•	Load different or new datasets with src/data/data_loader.py.
	•	Adjust the layout or add new pages in src/layouts/.
	•	Add, modify, or remove callbacks in src/callbacks/.

4.	Run Tests (optional)
    pytest tests

to ensure everything is working as expected.
